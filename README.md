# community-requests

Send your request to the DexTools team!

Community users can open and participate in dicussions in order to request:

- New features
- Blockchains integrations
- DEX integrations
- Bugs reports
- Provide feedback.
  
Discussions are moderated by DEXTools Community Managers. 

They will open tasks (issues) directly or from existing discussions after assessment and agreement to work on them.
